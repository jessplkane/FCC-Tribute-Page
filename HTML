        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <p>Yotam Ottolenghi was born in Jerusalem and grew up in Jerusalem's Ramat Denya neighbourhood. He has an older sister, Tirza Florentin and a late younger brother, Yiftach. His father was a chemistry teacher at the Hebrew University and his mother a teacher. He served in the IDF Army-intelligence headquarters. He studied at Tel Aviv University before completing a master's degree in comparative literature. At this time he also worked on the news desk of Haaretz, one of Israel's largest daily papers. He moved to Amsterdam with his then-partner Noam Bar. By 1997 he had completed his master's degree in philosophy and comparative literature; his thesis was on the ontological status of the photographic image in aesthetic and analytic philosophy. During his time there, Ottolenghi edited the Hebrew pages of a Dutch-Jewish weekly, NIW. Later in 1997, he moved again, this time to the UK, planning to start a PhD but before he enrolled he signed up to train at Le Cordon Bleu cookery school in London for six months. He got a job as head pastry chef at the London boutique bakery Baker & Spice and this is where he met Sami Tamimi and Dan Lepard. </p>

        <h3>Career</h3>
        <p>Following a six-month course at the London-based French cookery school, Le Cordon Bleu, in 1997, Ottolenghi worked as a pastry chef at The Capital Restaurant, the Michelin-starred restaurant in Knightsbridge. He eventually became head pastry chef at Baker and Spice in Chelsea, London, where he met Sami Tamimi – co-founder of their delicatessens and restaurants and co-author of the Ottolenghi and Jerusalem cookery books – in 1999. Together with Noam Bar, Ottolenghi and Sami Tamimi set up the first Ottolenghi deli in Notting Hill in 2002, selling both sweet and savoury food. The food in Ottolenghi is known to be bold, exciting, sometimes challenging. Three more delis opened: Islington (2004), Kensington (2005), and Belgravia (2007). A formal restaurant, NOPI (2011), followed and a further restaurant opened off Spitalfields market in London in 2014. Ottolenghi was a co-judge of BBC Radio 4's Food and Farming Awards 2016. He is also the author of four cookery books. Ottolenghi was also the subject of four television documentaries.

        <h3>Ottolenghi's Cooking</h3>
        <p>Ottolenghi's cooking style is rooted in his Middle Eastern upbringing: "a distinctive mix of Middle Eastern flavours – Syrian, Turkish, Lebanese, Iranian, Israeli and Armenian – with a western twist". His "particular skill" is in marrying the food of his native Israel with a wider range of textures and flavours from the Mediterranean, Middle East and Asia. His palate of flavours is unapologetically bold and loud: "noisy". Signature dishes include butternut squash salad with red onion, tahini and za'atar, roasted aubergine with turmeric yogurt and pomegranate seeds, chargrilled broccoli with chilli and fried garlic and meringues. Ottolenghi is known for emphasizing the use of vegetables at the same time as eating and loving meat. He defends the right to have an approach to cooking and eating that does not fit in with conventional distinctions and barriers: "You can be vegetarian and eat fish [...] there are no hard core divisions any more". This remark led to controversy within the vegetarian community encouraging Ottolenghi to later recant via Twitter: "To all, fish eaters are NOT vegetarians".
