FreeCodeCamp Project 
Build a Tribute Page

This is the first project I built as part of the FreeCodeCamp course, a pretty basic tribute page to chef Yotam Ottolenghi.

User Stories:
- I can view a tribute page with an image and text.
- I can click on a link that will take me to an external website with further information on the topic.
